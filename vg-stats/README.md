## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

Today we're taking a tour into Data Science to learn a bit more about the field and tools used in this space!

The best way to hone your data analysis skills is consisten, deliberate practice. One of the best places to acquire data for analysis is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), so practice your abilities with some [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

Sign up for a Kaggle account (if you don't already have one).
