## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

Today we're taking a tour into Data Science to learn a bit more about the field and tools used in this space!

The best way to hone your data analysis skills is consisten, deliberate practice. One of the best places to acquire data for analysis is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), so practice your abilities with some [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

Sign up for a Kaggle account (if you don't already have one).

## Feature Tasks

* [ ] Find and download the [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) Data Set - Sales data from more than 16,500 games

* [ ] Start a Jupyter Notebook called `vg-stats`
* [ ] Add a markdown cell at the top of the notebook with the title of this assignment, an appropriate name for the data set, as well as your name and the date
* [ ] Load up the Data Set into a Pandas DataFrame within the respective file

## Requirements

(*Note* that the numbers quoted for sales are in the millions, and apply only for those games with over 10,000 sales)

Answer the following questions:

[ ] 1. Which company is the most common video game publisher?

[ ] 2. What's the most common platform?

[ ] 3. What's the most common genre?

[ ] 4. What are the top 20 highest grossing gamess?

[ ] 5. For North American video game sales, what's the median?

* [ ] Provide a secondary output showing ten games surrounding the median sales output (assume that games with the same median value are sorted in descending order)

[ ] 6. For the top-selling game of all time, how many standard deviations above/below the mean are its sales for North America?

[ ] 7. The Nintendo Wii seems to have oudone itself with games. How does its average number of sales compare with all of the other platforms?

[ ] 8. Come up with 3 more questions that can be answered with this data set.
